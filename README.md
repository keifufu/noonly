# Noonly

Noon-ly, not no-only. Previously Aspire.  
This was my own mail service, password manager, screenshot host, cloud-drive-whatever thingie, and some more stuff.  
I threw a bunch of this old code together as a sort of archive.  
A lot of these were attempts to create new, better versions that I gave up on.  
I have lost track of a few rewrites, so this sadly isn't complete.  
I ran the newest revision (noonly-net-2021) until early 2023. Me and a couple of friends were using it until I abandoned it.

Don't judge me based on this code, this project was my introduction to web development.  
Given my current knowledge I tried to rewrite this in a much much better state for about two years (2021-2023), however I simply didn't have enough motivation.  
Proton Mail has been a great replacement for self-hosting mail.  
Bitwarden is a decent enough self hosted password manager.  
I don't need a web-cloud-drive whatever anymore, and just use samba on my home server.  
I did still need a replacement for the screenshot host and general ShareX sharing utility so i made [yass](https://github.com/keifufu/yass).
